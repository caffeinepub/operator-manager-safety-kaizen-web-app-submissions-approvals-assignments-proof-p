  "summary": "Manager and Operator profile pages were updated to include a prominent, page-level “Log out” button wired to the centralized `useAppLogout().logout` handler and styled to remain visible on mobile/desktop. However, the diff does not provide evidence that the logout action clears credential/admin-token state, clears the React Query cache, and navigates to `/login` (those behaviors are inside `useAppLogout`, which is not shown/changed here).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-78",
      "requirement": "Clicking the profile page \"Log out\" button clears the credential session (and any admin token state), clears the React Query cache, and navigates to /login.",
      "reason": "The profile pages call `logout` from `useAppLogout`, but the diff provides no evidence of what `logout` actually does (no changes or excerpts from `frontend/src/hooks/useAppLogout.ts`). Therefore the required side effects (clearing credential/admin token state, clearing React Query cache, redirecting to `/login`) cannot be verified from the provided diff summary alone.",
