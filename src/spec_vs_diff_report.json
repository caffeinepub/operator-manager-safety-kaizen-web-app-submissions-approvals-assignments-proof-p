  "summary": "REQ-31 appears implemented: the \"Download CSV\" button is now rendered in the page header row (right-aligned via flex justify-between) and is conditionally shown only when inactiveOperators.length > 0; the \"Inactive Operators\" card header no longer contains the button. CSV columns and filename format are consistent with the acceptance criteria based on the shown code, but additional error-handling logic was added that may alter CSV output in error cases.",

      "description": "Added error-handling/defensive logic in CSV data generation (try/catch, console.error, and fallback CSV row values like 'Last Activity': 'Error'), which is beyond pure UI relocation and could affect exported CSV content in some cases.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says no changes to backend APIs or CSV generation logic beyond the UI relocation; this adds new generation behavior for error cases.",
