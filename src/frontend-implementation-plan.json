        "When navigating to /manager/profile (as a Manager/Admin), a clearly visible \"Log out\" button is present on the page without relying on the header dropdown.",

        "Clicking the profile page \"Log out\" button clears the credential session (and any admin token state), clears the React Query cache, and navigates to /login.",
        "The \"Log out\" button remains visible and usable on both desktop and mobile layouts (no hidden/overflowed button in narrow widths)."
