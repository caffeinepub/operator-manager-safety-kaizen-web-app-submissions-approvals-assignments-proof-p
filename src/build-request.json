        "Clicking the profile page \"Log out\" button clears the credential session (and any admin token state), clears the React Query cache, and navigates to /login.",
        "The \"Log out\" button remains visible and usable on both desktop and mobile layouts (no hidden/overflowed button in narrow widths)."
